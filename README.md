# D365 Sales Demo Data Generator (GitHub Pages)

This single-page app packages Contoso Coffee demo CSVs (or your own) into a ZIP for quick import into Dynamics 365 Sales. It requires only **two inputs**:

1) **Demo Type**: `Contoso Coffee` or `Custom`  
   - If `Custom`, provide a **Customer name**. The app will generate a minimal `businessunit.csv` using that name.

2) **Demo Users**: `Contoso Coffee` or `Custom`  
   - If `Custom`, upload a `users.csv` **with the same headers as the sample**. This replaces `User.csv` in the package. All other data uses the sample CSVs in this repo.

## ðŸ—‚ Repo layout

Place your CSVs under `data/` **with these exact filenames** (case-sensitive):

```
data/
â”œâ”€ Territory.csv
â”œâ”€ Appointments.csv
â”œâ”€ Contact.csv
â”œâ”€ Goal.csv
â”œâ”€ Campaign.csv
â”œâ”€ User.csv
â”œâ”€ Product.csv
â”œâ”€ Opportunity.csv
â”œâ”€ Account.csv
â””â”€ Emails.csv
```

`index.html` is in the repo root and fetches the files from `/data/` by default.

> If you keep the CSVs in the root instead of `data/`, edit `RELATIVE_SAMPLE_FILES` in `index.html` accordingly.

## ðŸš€ Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Commit `index.html` (from this repo) at the **repo root** and all CSVs in the **`data/` folder**.
2. Go to **Settings â†’ Pages** and set:
   - **Source**: *Deploy from a branch*
   - **Branch**: `main` and **/(root)** folder
3. Wait for the Pages URL to appear (e.g., `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`).

## âœ… Smoke test (2 minutes)

1. Open your Pages URL.
2. Click **Prepare Demo Package**. You should see logs for each CSV loading and the progress bar reach 100%.
3. Click **Download CSV ZIP** and confirm a ZIP downloads.
4. Test both modes:
   - **Contoso / Contoso** (no uploads)
   - **Custom / Custom** (enter Customer Name, upload your `users.csv` that matches sample headers)

---

## ðŸ”§ Notes & Troubleshooting

- **Header validation for users**: The app checks your uploaded `users.csv` against the sample headers and will log any missing columns.
- **Cache**: Use a hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) after updating CSVs.
- **businessunit.csv**: Generated on the fly using your Demo Type selection.
- **No other inputs**: All other configuration is fixed to the sample data files for a consistent demo.
